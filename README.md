### GitHub Quick Tips 
##### (Dear students, please refer to my two comprehensive PDF files about using Git, GitHub, and GitPod for more details and explanations)
### New Repo
You can start a new empty repo on GitHub first by adding the essentials "README.md" and .gitignore, and then you can clone it to your local machine. GitHub will use the "main" branch by default.
- To clone a repo (I used my repo as an example):
> git clone https://github.com/anmarjarjees/git-review.git

- To connect your local folder with your remote repo, my example:
> git remote add origin https://github.com/anmarjarjees/git-basic.git
- To download all the files that only exist in the remote repo:
> git pull origin main
- To list (view) the remote repo(s) (GitHub, Heroku, etc.) of your current local project, you can type:
>	git remote -v

NOTE: We need to pull the changes/differences in the main online repo before pushing the local ones to avoid any conflict
- Add all your new/updated files to staging:
> git add .

- Commit your changes with the required text
> git commit -m "updating with initial code"

- Push/Upload your code to GitHub
> git push origin master
OR:
> git push origin main

- You can always check your repo status:
> git status

- You can also check your repo branch name:
> git branch

# Main Branch and Master Branch:
GitHub creates the repository with a single branch. This first branch in the repository is the default branch. The default branch is the branch that GitHub displays when anyone visits your repository. By default, GitHub names the default branch *"main"* in any new repository.

When we do the other way by first creating/converting a local folder into a git repo "git init" and then adding an empty GitHub repo later to upload (push) our files, Git will use the "master" branch to be the default one, but we should always use "main" as the default main branch. To avoid naming our branch with "master" we need to use this command:  

  > git branch -M main

GitHub will remind us by listing the following commands when we create an empty repo which are the steps to do locally:
  > git init

  > git add README.md
  
  > git commit -m "first commit"
  
  > git branch -M main
  
  > git remote add origin https://github.com/anmarjarjees/git-first-way.git
  
  > git push -u origin main

â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line
  
  > git remote add origin https://github.com/anmarjarjees/git-first-way.git
  
  > git branch -M main
  
  > git push -u origin main

Notice that -u flag for "upstream" creates a tracking reference for every branch that you successfully push onto the remote repository. based on Git *"For every branch that is up to date or successfully pushed, add upstream (tracking) reference, used by argument-less git-pull[1] and other commands"*.

Example:
instead of:
  > git pull origin main
 we can just use:
  > git pull


- in case you added (staged) all folders/files and forget to ignore some with .gitignore, and you need to unstage everything and start again, you can use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage [based on git comment]:
> git restore --staged <file>
<br> OR for unstaging everything:<br>
> git restore --staged *

Based on "git-scm.com" documentation:<b>
Git version 2.23.0 introduced a new command: "git restore". It's an alternative to "git reset". From Git version 2.23.0 onwards, Git will use git restore instead of git reset for many undo operations.

### Branch NOTES: 
- Make sure to upload the public code that you want to share into your default branch whether it's "main" or "master" for immediate and easy access
- You can select/set your default branch:
-- Go to "Settings"
-- Under the "Code and automation" section on the left sidebar, select/click "Branches"
-- Click the two opposite arrows icon to see the switching branch menu
-- Select the branch that you want to set as a default then click "Update"
-- Accept the warning of doing these changes "I understand, update the default branch"
