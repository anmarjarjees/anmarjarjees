### GitHub Quick Tips 
##### (Dear students, please refer to my two comprehensive pdf files about using Git, GitHub, and GitPod for more details and explinations)
- To connect your local folder with your remote repo, my example:
> git remote add origin https://github.com/anmarjarjees/git-basic.git
- To download all the files that only exist in the remote repo:
> git pull origin master
OR: <br>
> git pull origin main

NOTE: We need to pull the changes/differences in the main repo before pushing the local ones to avoid the conflict
- Add all your new/updated files to staging:
> git add .

- Commit your changes with the required text
> git commit -m "updating with initial code"

- Push/Upload your code to GitHub
> git push origin master

OR:
> git push origin main

- You can always check your repo status:
> git status

- You can also check your repo branch name:
> git branch

### NOTES: 
- Make sure to upload the public code that you want to share into your default branch whether it's "main" or "master" for immediate and easy access
- You can select/set your default branch:
-- Go to "Settings"
-- Under the "Code and automation" section on the left sidebar, select/click "Branches"
-- Click the two opposite arrows icon to see the switching branch menu
-- Select the branch that you want to set as a default then click "Update"
-- Accept the warning of doing these changes "I understand, update the default branch"

### MARKDOWN Language:
